Reasons for tools using for automation:

Maven - 
Is a build and dependency managment tool; It has many benefits like pulling all the dependencies specified in pom.xml, maintains the project structure very well, easy to understand.

Cucumber: 
We can write the feature files so that non-technical team also can read what automated tests are running and so on.

Tests will run with one command â€˜man clean test'

Page factory: 
Easy to maintain, Increased readabibility
