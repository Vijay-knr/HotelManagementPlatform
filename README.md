Reasons for tools using for automation:

1.Maven - 
Is a build and dependency managment tool; It has many benefits like pulling all the dependencies specified in pom.xml, maintains the project structure very well, easy to understand.

2. Cucumber: 
We can write the feature files so that non-technical team also can read what automated tests are running and so on.

3. Page factory: 
Easy to maintain, Increased readabibility

Please Note: 
1. Can't create multiple entries as there is no option for that.
2. Tests can run with one command â€˜mvn clean test'

2.Search is case sensitive.
3.No information message if user trying to create with empty data.
4.There is no information about mandatory fields.
